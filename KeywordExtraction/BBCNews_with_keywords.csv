1,record fails to lift lacklustre meet  yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham  and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking a world record  apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and i would like to see her have a go at m in competition mind you every time she breaks the record she gets  so she can afford to be deliberate about it world records aside i thought it was a very encouraging evenings work for kelly holmes she looked good and was very positive agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the worlds top three m runners this season yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last m as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kelly my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just hasnt convinced herself she is fit enough to do so on the other hand i think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the mens m in madrid he started well in the final but still could not stay with the frontrunners jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish  it would have been nice to see what mark lewisfrancis could have done in the final if only he hadnt got himself disqualified he was blatantly playing the falsestart game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly my view is youre meant to go when the gun goes and not before and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the falsestart tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again having said that mark is looking in much better shape but i havent seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests frances ronald pognon  who has run  seconds  will be under threat at the europeans from a british point of view sarah claxtons victory in the m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet  something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the womens national m race in a new personal best of  seconds aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong xm squad going to the european championships scotlands lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal from an international perspective i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the m but i dont think the pacemaking was great canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last years shape she would have given defar a real run for her money she had a go but just could not hang in there we were also expecting a bit more from bernard lagat in the mens m but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shape as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season it was very

26,time to get tough on friendlies  for an international manager a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players  the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the  minutes at the end  i would say its  whether you should have these games or not and if

some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the minutes at the end i would say its whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say youre better not doing so it would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing the more you play together the easier it is when it comes

75,european medal chances improve  what have the european indoor trials told us well i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects  it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around  the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxtons win in the m hurdles running subeight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal but what was great about sundays performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah and knowing that she got the better of diane in a headtohead race will give sarah confidence in the mens race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him in fact the mens m hurdles is so strong i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid  phillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of m which puts him at the top of the world rankings i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him  but then phillips always has a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency  and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and m hurdles and you cant ask for more than that kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what weve seen so far  she has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well it wasnt all good news in sheffield i thought both the m races were disappointing in different ways jason gardener may have won but he wasnt at his best i chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an offday for him hes there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there in the womens race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka the pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with a chest infection if she had made the final i think jeanette would have gone a bit quicker  janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a twoyear drugs ban but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldnt be the case the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help her a couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf findlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain yusuf who came third in the m is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship he came to britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent so we shall have to see what happens to both of them ,"sports, sheffield,

championships, high jump, long jump, pole vault",european medal chances improve what have the european indoor trials told us well i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxtons win in the m hurdles running subeight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal but what was great about sundays performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah and knowing that she got the better of diane in a headtohead race will give sarah confidence in the mens race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him in fact the mens m hurdles is so strong i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid phillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of m which puts him at the top of the world rankings i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him but then phillips always has a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and m hurdles and you cant ask for more than that kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every

nearly four years with a sixtry victory in rome tries from jonathan thomas tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors a halftime advantage luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but secondhalf efforts from brent cockbain shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory flyhalf stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this years tournament starting full of confidence after their victory over england the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes diminutive wing shane williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short the ball was switched left and michael owens long cutout pass gave the lurking thomas an easy runin stephen jones who retained the kicking duties despite gavin hensons heroics against england slotted an excellent conversion from wide out wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass and italy hit back out of the blue in the th minute henson sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england beat two players with ease out on the left touchline but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner with the welsh lineout stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors scrum the home sides forward power brought them back into it but a clever high kick from henson almost brought a try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch wales regained control with a second try in the st minute henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his th test try jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for italy henson was also narrowly short with a longrange effort at goal but wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he offloaded to martyn williams the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post jones adding the conversion italy who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with a head knock before halftime built up a head of steam on the resumption de marigny landed a penalty to make it and a nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knockon but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour their fourth after minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams who beat several players with ease and finished with a powerful angled run from lock cockbain before italy could recover from that blow a strong surge from gareth thomas and great offloads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over with jones converting both for a lead wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter the icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner the only downside for wales was a hamstring injury suffered by luscombe but after backtoback wins

southgates misdirected effort but despite the charlton protests his goal stood the addicks did not let their heads drop and bartlett left the boro defence standing picking up hreidarssons cross to easily sink his rightfooted strike but substitute graham was on hand to grab a share of the points for the home side the yearold striker nodding home the equaliser and his first premiership goal with five minutes left on the clock i felt we did enough to win the game even though the first half was lacklustre we dominated after the break the players showed a fantastic response and we should have gone on to win but for charlton goalkeeper dean kiely who made three tremendous saves we could have scored five or six to take the lead and then to get penned back it feels a little bit like a defeat admitted kiely we were winning but middlesbrough kept knocking on the door but we stood up and credit to us we didnt capitulate well kick on now our shortterm ambition is to progress from the seventh
