Machine Learning Projects: Text Summarization & Keyword Extraction
This repository contains two Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects that demonstrate summarization and keyword extraction capabilities using state-of-the-art models and deployment with Streamlit.

Task 1: Text Summarization using BART Transformer
Objective :
 
To generate concise summaries for large paragraphs using the BART transformer model and evaluate the quality of generated summaries using the ROUGE metric.

Description :
 
The task uses a dataset with multiple long-text paragraphs.
The BART model (facebook/bart-large-cnn) from Hugging Face is used to generate 3â€“5 line summaries for each paragraph.
Each paragraph is processed individually, and a corresponding summary is generated.

ðŸ› Tools & Technologies :

Python
Hugging Face Transformers (BART)
ROUGE Evaluation (rouge_score)
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

Streamlit for deployment :

Evaluation :
ROUGE Score (F1) is used to evaluate the performance of the summarization.
A line plot of the F1-score distribution is included to visualize the quality of the summaries.

Deployment :
The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input text or select paragraphs and view their summaries alongside ROUGE scores.




Task 2: Keyword Extraction using OpenAI
Objective:

To extract meaningful keywords from full news articles and categorize them based on topics like "Sports", "Politics", "United Kingdom", etc.

Description :

The BBC News dataset is used where each row contains a full news article.
OpenAIâ€™s GPT model is used to extract keywords for each article.
The extracted keywords are stored in a separate file for further analysis.

Tools & Technologies:

Python
OpenAI API
Pandas
Streamlit

Features :

Performs keyword extraction for all articles in the dataset.
Allows filtering by fields/domains (e.g., "Sports", "United Kingdom").
Computes a relevance score for each keyword.
Users can download the refined keyword list as a CSV file from the Streamlit interface.

Deployment : 
Implemented using Streamlit for interactive exploration.







Installation & Setup
